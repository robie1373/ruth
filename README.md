# Ruth

TODO: Ruth is an agent which gets installed on endpoints. Ruth will watch configured files and directories for changes. Ruth will keep hashes of all files in the watched directories with the help of Edgar (TODO: include link). Ruth uses hashes to determine if a change has occurred. Ruth will have a few notification options. Ruth will have Enterprise appropriate configuration and update tools.

## Installation

Ruth will be provided with an installer for Windows systems. Possibly for others too. It is intended to run as a service/daemon.

In the meantime you can play around by:
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ruth'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruth
